    <h2> Inspiration </h2>

https://github.com/jomariya23156/face-recognition-with-liveness-web-login

I would highly suggest all of you to take a look at this wonderful project which served as the inspiration for my project.jomariya23156 has also beautifully incorporated face-recognition into his app which has been omitted in my project.

	<h2> Drawback </h2>
	
The drawback of the above mentioned project is that although it claims to be a web app it cannot be used in a server-client scenario as it lacks webrtc features.

Start developing locally.

### Step 1: Clone the repo

Fork the repository. then clone the repo locally by doing -

```sh
git clone https://github.com/abhisheknaiidu/iiitdmj-gpa.git
```

### Step 2: create a virtual environment and activate it. Note: I have used pip

```sh
pip install virtualenv
python -m venv [env-name]
[env-name]\Scripts\activate 
```

### Step 3: cd into the directory

```sh
cd iiitdmj-gpa
```

# install dependencies

```sh
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
 
# And you are good to go
